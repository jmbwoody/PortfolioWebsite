    I Worked with client Aliv, a phone company located in the Bahamas to develop a new fully functional customer facing app for Android and Iphone that is fully compatible with all mobile devices. \n
    I created the app for customers to login and pay bills, add minutes and data to their account, transfer money, receive notifications, and gift items to other phone accounts. Users that have corporate access can also view all of their corporate accounts from one portal in a fully functional mobile app. \n
    Developed a new billing app that is used for updating Kansys clients billing portals. \n
    The Aliv client required the use of Visual Studio in a .Net environment making use of  Javascript ES5 (for backward capability), HTML, and CSS.\n
    For the new Edge billing application, I developed in a full-stack environment using Node, JS, Webpack, React JS, Github, and Sourcetree. \n

    Created a new client UI for websites based on photoshop templates. \n
    Maintain over 50 websites in a CMS (MarcomCentral) by updating outdated UI with CSS3, HTML5, jQuery, and Javascript. Bridge the gap between the CMS and the .Net environment by creating Iframes for custom content. \n
    Use of an internally built engine (Brand Manager) to create complex form driven HTML5/CSS3 applications with the ability to display and validate accurate data transmission to the server with the use of Javascript and Jquery. \n
    Utilize Javascript object oriented programming. Analyze multi-dimensional data arrays to assign user access and requirements for specific user data-driven forms. \n
    Utilize jQuery to miniplate server side code for client specific UI and business requirements. \n
    Use of Visual Studio in a .Net environment. As a front-end developer, I code with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery to create interactive design with a secure, valid, and accurate data transmission to the back-end.\n
